# A universe driven by a racing interaction
What if there were a fourth type of interaction in the universe? Along with repulsion, attraction, neutral enter racing; where an interaction is a behavior between entities. While the 3 basic interactions, repulsion, attraction and neurtal (indifference) are intuitive, the fourth, racing, requires an introduction: racing, or chase interaction, describes the behavior between two entities where one entity runs away from a second that chases it. Indifference between two entities indicates total absences of interactions, i.e., pair of entities that exhibit indifference simply are not aware of each other existence.
The magnitude of an interaction between any two entities is proportional to the inverse of the square of their distance.
